# Arboreal

## Overview

The purpose of the Arboreal project is to create and evaluate tools for monitoring and managing tree farms. It was inspired by the advent of [Azure FarmBeats](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/democratizing-agriculture-intelligence-introducing-azure-farmbeats/) and will look at applying the FarmBeat tools to tree farming as well as tools unique to the timber industry.
